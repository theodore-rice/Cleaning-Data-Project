##The variables in question are as follows

- variables beginning tBodyAcc the body component of the axial raw signal from the accelerometer in each of the X,Y,Z directions captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz, the means and standard deviations of each
- variables beginning tBodyGyro the body component of the axial raw signal from the gyroscope in each of the X,Y,Z directions captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz, the means and standard deviations of each
- variables beginning tBodyAccJerk Jerk (derivative of acceleration) for the accelerometer component
- variables beginning tBodtGyroJerk Jerk (derivative of acceleration) for the gyroscope component
- variables ending in Mag the magnitude of the three dimensional signals (in the Euclidean norm) for each signal.
- variables beginning fbody results of a Fast Fourier Transform being applied.

###We give the means of each of the variables for each participant for each activity
